    <h1>Introduction</h1>
</div>
<p>
    I was working on a system that included a mobile app that talked to a web service.  In the past, when building
    those kinds of systems, we built the server to have both an http and https implementation, and we would only
    accept http connections on our local network.  Doing so gave us the ability to inspect and possibly alter the data
    flowing between the mobile apps and the web service.  We found the ability to inspect and alter to be most useful
    in debugging and writing system tests.  Some projects included a proxy
    (<a href="https://github.com/GraciesPadre/httpProxy"> the proxy project is here</a>)
    we configured to return predictable results or predictable errors as a means of validation.
</p>

<p>
    Because we had both https and http servers, we could use the http connection when we wanted to read the traffic
    without having to configure certificates
    into a proxy.  A project I recently worked on included a server that only supplied https endpoints.  So, I thought
    I'd just write myself a simple web server in go that exposed http endpoints mimicking those of the real service.
    Then we could just add a scheme for the app to use the http server as the base URL for those endpoints where we
    wanted to be able to provide controlled responses, possibly containing faults of our choosing.
    However, for some time now, iOS has not allowed http connections without updating security settings in your app.
    It got to be a maintenance problem providing separate security contexts for the different schemes in our app.
    So, I decided to learn how to write a web server in go that would serve up https endpoints configured with
    self-signed certificates, because I'm too big a miser to spring for authenticated certificates.
</p>

<p>
    The result is this project -- a web server that serves up endpoints to simulate getting a system image update
    file that would be used to keep a separate device's operating software image up to date.  It was surprisingly
    easy to do.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <h1>Overview</h1>
</div>

<p>
    The web server has 2 endpoints: one that returns a payload with latest available system image version, along
    with the URL that returns the image file; and the second that is the endpoint that actually returns the
    file.
</p>

<p>
    I used <a href="https://github.com/gorilla/mux"> gorilla mux</a> to distribute endpoint requests to the
    appropriate handler, because I like its syntax for specifying URL parameters.
</p>

<p>
    You'll see several references to &quot;Gracie&quot; and &quot;Spitz&quot;.  Gracie is my dog -- a Spitz.
    There is much contention about whether she is my dog or I am her human.
</p>

<p>
    The &quot;binary image file&quot; the server returns is just a text file with numbers in it.

   "deviceType" : "Spitz",

   "version" : "gracie_02"
}

</p>

<p>
    Breaking down the curl command, &quot;2&quot; in the URL parameter is the device type code for our fictitious external device.  It has
    no real significance otherwise.  The &quot;-k&quot; parameter instructs curl to accept a self-signed
    certificate.  &quot;-v&quot; emits all the stuff we need to convince ourselves that there really is a certificate
    exchange taking place.
</p>

<p>
    We see the response has a URL pointing to our system image file.  Using that endpoint, we get
</p>

<p>
<pre>
curl -k https://10.0.0.28:8080/gracie/r_gracie_02.bin

1
...
50000
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Which is what we expect, as our image file is just a text file with numbers from 1 - 50000.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <h1>Implementation</h1>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <h2>Generating The Certificate</h2>
</div>

<p>
    The first step is to generate a certificate signing request file.

<pre>
openssl req -new -subj "/C=US/ST=Colorado/CN=10.0.0.28" -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.csr
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Once we have that, we generate the actual certificate

<pre>
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in localhost.csr -signkey localhost.key -out localhost.crt
</pre>
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <h2>Web Server Main</h2>
</div>

<p>
    Once we have our certificate, serving up the content is simply a matter of using go's http module, calling
    ListenAndServeTLS.

<pre>
func main() {
	useHttp := false

	for i, arg := range os.Args[1:] {
		if arg == "-useHttp" {
			useHttp = true
		}

		if arg == "-reportOldUpdateVersion" {
			latestUpdateRev = "gracie_01"
		}

		if arg == "-networkInterfaceName" {
			if len(os.Args) > i+2 {
				// We're looking at args starting at index 1, so, to get the next arg, we need to increment
				// the current arg index and add 1 to account for not starting at 0.
				networkInterfaceName = os.Args[i+2]
			}
		}
	}

	router := mux.NewRouter()
	router.HandleFunc("/update/{model}/latest", updateMetaDataHandler)
	router.HandleFunc("/gracie/{fileName}", FileDownloadHandler)

	fmt.Println("Starting update server on network interface:", networkInterfaceName, "port:", port)

	if useHttp {
		log.Fatalln(http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(":%d", port), router))
	} else {
		<b>log.Fatalln(http.ListenAndServeTLS(fmt.Sprintf(":%d", port), "localhost.crt", "localhost.key", router))</b>
	}
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    ListenAndServeTLS takes as parameters the certificate file (localhost.crt) and key (localhost.key) we generated
    from our certificate signing request file (localhost.csr).
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <h1>Wrapping Up</h1>
</div>

<p>
    The remaining part of this project that is of interest is serving up the system image file, which is included in file set
    containing this document and the project source.  We set the http response content type to &quot;octet-stream&quot;.
    Were we serving a bigger file, I'd probably use chunked encoding, but that's another project.

<pre>
func FileDownloadHandler(responseWriter http.ResponseWriter, httpRequest *http.Request) {
	vars := mux.Vars(httpRequest)
	fileName, ok := vars["fileName"]

	if !ok {
		responseWriter.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
		_, err := responseWriter.Write([]byte("No file name in request\n"))
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Could not write no file name response")
		}

		return
	}

	fileData, err := os.ReadFile(fileName)
	if err != nil {
		responseWriter.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
		_, err := responseWriter.Write([]byte("Could not read file\n"))
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Could not write read file response")
		}

		return
	}

	responseWriter.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	<b>responseWriter.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/octet-stream")</b>
	_, err = responseWriter.Write(fileData)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Writing result failed")
	}
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    So, there you have it.  The repo containing this document also contains the project source code.
